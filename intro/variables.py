# in naming ur variables, you should follow some naming conventions
# like camelCase and snake_case
myName = "chidubem ernest" #camelCase
my_name = "restek" #snake_case
print(my_name) 
print(myName)

# in this case, the data are assigned to the corresponding variable
a,b,c = 1,2,3
print(a)
print(b)
print(c)

# to resign or redclare you should just assign a new data to it 
a = "bigal"
print(a)
a = "ifemelumma"
print(a)

# to delete a variable, you use the function 'del variable name'

x = 2
print(x)
del (x)
print(x)
